- Inputs, assumptions, and outputs of a model

(Write explanation later)

---

## 2. Why This Lecture is Important
This lecture:
- Sets the foundation for the entire course
- Prevents common misconceptions later
- Establishes modeling intuition before mathematics

(Write explanation later)

---

## 3. How the Topic is Presented
### Slides
- Slides introduce concepts visually and intuitively
- Definitions are explained informally before formal notation

### Notebook
- Demonstrates simple examples
- Shows how assumptions affect results

(Write explanation later)

---

## 4. When and Where These Ideas Apply
- When statistical modeling is appropriate
- When it is not appropriate
- Typical misuse of models

(Write explanation later)

---

## 5. Common Student Difficulties
- Confusing data analysis with modeling
- Ignoring assumptions
- Treating models as exact representations

(Add later)
