Purpose of the Lecture This lecture establishes the foundational setup required for the course. The goals are to: - Introduce the primary textbook used throughout the semester - Set up a reproducible Python environment - Install and verify the PyMC probabilistic programming library - Prepare students for Bayesian modeling workflows used in later lectures This lecture is primarily practical and preparatory, ensuring that all students begin the course with a consistent computational environment. 2. Python Environment Overview The following configuration is recommended for the course: Python version: 3.12.5 Environment manager: Conda Conda version: 25.1.1 Package channel: conda-forge Primary library: PyMC A dedicated Conda environment is required to avoid dependency conflicts and ensure reproducibility across platforms. 3. Environment Setup 3.1 Installing Conda If Conda is not already installed, choose one of the following: Miniconda (recommended): https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution After installation, open: - Windows: Anaconda Prompt - Linux/macOS: Terminal 3.2 Creating and Activating a Conda Environment conda create -n pymc_env python=3.12.5 conda activate pymc_env 3.3 Updating Conda (Recommended) conda update -n base -c defaults conda 3.4 Installing PyMC conda install -c conda-forge pymc 3.5 Optional: Installing ArviZ conda install -c conda-forge arviz 3.6 Optional: Installing JupyterLab conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab jupyter lab 4. Verifying the Installation python import pymc as pm import arviz as az import numpy as np print(pm.__version__) print(az.__version__) 5. Minimal PyMC Test Model import pymc as pm with pm.Model(): p = pm.Beta(\"p\", alpha=1, beta=1) y = pm.Bernoulli(\"y\", p=p, observed=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]) trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, progressbar=False) 6. Common Issues to Avoid Installing PyMC using pip in the base environment Mixing pip and conda for core scientific libraries Installing unnecessary system compilers or MSYS2 7. Key Takeaways Always use conda-forge Always create a dedicated Conda environment No compiler installation is required PyMC works reliably on major operating systems Resources Slides (PDF): \u2014 Slides (PPT): \u2014 Notebook: Environment setup and PyMC installation Dataset: \u2014","title":"Lecture 1"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#lecture-1","text":"","title":"Lecture 1"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#textbook","text":"Book: Osvaldo Martin, Bayesian Analysis with Python (2024), Packt Publishing Access link: Access link Chapter: \u2014 Sections: \u2014","title":"Textbook"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#1-purpose-of-the-lecture","text":"This lecture establishes the foundational setup required for the course.
