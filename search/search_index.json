Lecture Focus This introductory lecture establishes the foundation for the course by: - Identifying the primary textbook - Setting up a reproducible Python environment - Installing and validating PyMC - Preparing students for Bayesian modeling workflows used throughout the course 2. Python Environment for the Course Python version: 3.12.5 Conda version: 25.1.1 Environment manager: Conda Package channel: conda-forge Primary library: PyMC A dedicated Conda environment is required to ensure consistency and avoid dependency conflicts. 3. Environment Setup (PyMC) 3.1 Install Conda If Conda is not already installed: Miniconda (recommended, lightweight): https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html Anaconda (full distribution): https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution After installation, open: - Windows: Anaconda Prompt - Linux/macOS: Terminal 3.2 Create and Activate a New Conda Environment Create a clean environment: conda create -n pymc_env python=3.12.5 Activate the environment: conda activate pymc_env 3.3 Update Conda (Recommended) conda update -n base -c defaults conda This helps prevent dependency resolution issues. 3.4 Install PyMC from conda-forge conda install -c conda-forge pymc This installs PyMC along with required scientific dependencies, including: - NumPy - SciPy - PyTensor - ArviZ (usually included) No C compiler or MSYS2 installation is required. 3.5 (Optional) Explicitly Install ArviZ conda install -c conda-forge arviz 3.6 (Optional) Install JupyterLab For interactive lectures and notebooks: conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab Launch JupyterLab: jupyter lab 4. Verify Installation Start Python: python Run the following commands: import pymc as pm import arviz as az import numpy as np print(pm.__version__) print(az.__version__) If no errors occur, the installation is successful. 5. Minimal PyMC Test Model (Sanity Check) import pymc as pm with pm.Model(): p = pm.Beta(\"p\", alpha=1, beta=1) y = pm.Bernoulli(\"y\", p=p, observed=[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]) trace = pm.sample(1000, tune=1000, progressbar=False) Successful sampling confirms that PyMC is fully functional. 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid Installing PyMC with pip in the base environment Mixing pip and conda for core scientific libraries Installing unnecessary system compilers or MSYS2 7. Summary for Students Always use conda-forge Always create a new Conda environment No compiler is required PyMC works out-of-the-box on major platforms Resources Slides (PDF): \u2014 Slides (PPT): \u2014 Notebook: Environment setup and PyMC installation Dataset: \u2014","title":"Lecture 1"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#lecture-1","text":"","title":"Lecture 1"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#textbook","text":"Book: Osvaldo Martin \u2014 Bayesian Analysis with Python (2024, Packt Publishing) Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y4V95w5-eUT2ufC85Rk-1jIccm4hh_St/view?usp=sharing Chapter: \u2014 Sections: \u2014","title":"Textbook"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"week01/lecture1/#1-lecture-focus","text":"This introductory lecture establishes the foundation for the course by: - Identifying the primary textbook - Setting up a reproducible Python environment - Installing and validating PyMC - Preparing students for Bayesian modeling workflows used throughout the course","title":"1.
